<p>Before you put your solution into operation, you have to activate the license
key you have purchased for your product edition. To ensure maximum reliability
and performance, your system should be kept updated, which is why you need to
configure the update system.</p> 

<p>If your project is standards-compliant and conforms to the present quality
control checklist, Bitrix Framework updates will never cause any damage to it.</p>

<ol>
<li>Open "Settings &gt; System Settings &gt; Module Settings &gt; Main" and select the "Update
  System" tab. Check if the license key is present and valid.<p>Mark the "Autocheck For Updates"
  option to receive updates as soon as they become available. Daily check is
  recommended.</p></li>

<li>Open "Settings &gt; Updates" and find the "Update server response"
  section. It contains details on the license key, the installed product edition
  and the update period.</li>
