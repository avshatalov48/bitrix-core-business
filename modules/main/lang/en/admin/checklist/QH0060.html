<p>The web project uses the OS calls to send any kind of e-mail messages: new
user registration confirmation; order notification etc. If the mail subsystem is
not configured properly, the e-mail messages may be placed in a spam folder,
have incorrect headers or not reach destination at all.</p>

<ol>
<li>If you have the Subscription module installed, create a test distribution
  issue, with some files enclosed, in "Services &gt; Newsletters &gt; Newsletter
  issues" and sent it to yourself. Having received the e-mail message, analyze
  its headers and have your system administrator help you configure the mail
  subsystem if necessary.</li>

<li>Otherwise, if you don't have the Subscription module, open your account for
  editing and enable the "Notify User" option (or use any other type
  of notification) and then save your account. You will receive the notification
  message. Analyze it as described in (1).</li> 

<li>Ask the developer to send a test message to you using PHP functions.</li> 

<li>If you don't see any incoming message at all, it is likely that it has been
  placed in the spam folder.</li> 
 </ol>
