<p>The PHP programming language includes a built-in mechanism to control code
robustness. To reduce errors in your code, eliminate version migration risks and
increase development and debugging speed, use <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.constants.php">maximum
error level</a>:
E_ALL and E_STRICT.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ensure your team develops custom components and modules using strict error mode.</li>
</ul>
