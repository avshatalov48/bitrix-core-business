<p>A sitemap for a Bitrix Framework powered website is created automatically
using the menu type settings ("Settings &gt; System Settings &gt; Module
Settings", select Kernel module, click the "Settings" tab, scroll to
the "Sitemap" section). It is essential that you provide a means to edit
and configure menus of these types. For example, you can describe the sitemap
logic in the web project specifications emphasizing on aspects of the
configuration of the sitemap's dynamic subsections.</p>

<ul>

  <li>Ensure the sitemap folders and items can be edited without the assistance
    of developers.</li>
</ul>
