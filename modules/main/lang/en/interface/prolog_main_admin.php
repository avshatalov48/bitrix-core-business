that for common users with a response time of up to 24 hours. You still can
continue using the product as long as you want. To get access to system updates and Marketplace, you have to renew your subscription.<br/><br/>
 You are granted a grace period of one month (30 days) after expiration within which the
renewal cost is only 22% of the price of your product edition (early renewal).<br/><br/>
 After that period, the renewal cost is 60% of the price of your product

Also, your support tickets submitted to our HelpDesk will be processed with a lower priority (you may need to wait up to 48 hours).<br /><br />
Although renewing the technical support and product updates subscription is not mandatory, we encourage you to renew your subscription for another year. Product updates include critical bug fixes, patches and new functionality. With an active subscription, you can install new modules, features, and site templates that become available with each new product release, and upgrade your product copy to the latest version.
<br /><br />
You can renew your maintenance subscription for one additional year for 25% of the current price of your product edition (product option).
<br /><br />
For older product editions (\"InfoPace\", \"TeamPace\", \"BizPace\", \"BizPace Enterprise\"), you can renew your maintenance subscription for one additional year for 22% of the current product price (Early Renewal option) within a 30-day period after your maintenance subscription expiration date, or for 60% of the current product price (Late Renewal option) anytime thereafter. Please note that for older product editions any number of additional intranet users (those exceeding the default 25-user pack) must be renewed additionally.
