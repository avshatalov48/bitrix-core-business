<p>A website is usually managed by several functionally different user groups;
at the top of the pyramid is the "Administrators" user group with
maximum access. All these user groups and their permissions are defined in the
website specifications. For maximum protection against known and potential
threats, it is strongly recommended to give each of the user groups only the necessary
permissions on a need-to-do basis: first remove all the permissions entirely and
then add the required ones.</p>

<p>For example, if a user is to be allowed to edit the phone number in the
footer area, create a user group with one and only permission to edit this
information. Similarly, if a user's jobs is to manage only some information
blocks, he or she must not be allowed to edit anything else.</p>

<p>What is the reason to be so restrictive?</p>

<ol>
<li>To keep information on a need-to-know basis. A content editor must not see
  product keys if his or her job is to edit content.</li>
<li>In theory, any user account may be hacked by a variety of methods:
<ul>
<li>the password may be intercepted and sent to another machine by a virus (which
  is of extreme importance for freelancers working at home);</li>
<li>the password may be simply overseen by a malicious person;</li> 
<li>a user may keep the password on a sticky note;</li> 
<li>the password may be intercepted by a TCP listener;</li> 
<li>weak passwords may be easily bruteforced.</li> 
 </ul>
</li> 
 </ol>

<p>User access privileges must not be crucial for system
security. Assigning the administrator permissions to all users is the most
common blunder which may entail catastrophe.</p>


<ol>
<li>Review the user groups existing in the system: "Settings > Users > User
  Groups". Check the permissions of each group except for the "Administrators" (it
  will be examined individually).<br>
</li>

<li>Check the each group's access permission for the system modules. If a groups
  has the "default" permission for a module under review, ensure the
  default settings will not do any damage: open the respective module settings
  form: "Settings > System Settings > Module Settings > <i>Module_Name</i>",
  click the "Access" tab.<p>The default access value is initially
  highly restrictive: "Access denied"; check that it was not changed. Read
  the documentation before configuring the permissions because different
  permissions may have different meaning in the modules.</p></li> 

<li>If a user group has a "Edit files and folders" permission in the "Site
  Explorer" module, open "Content &gt; Site Explorer &gt; Files and
  Folders" and ensure this user group cannot access any file system objects
  other than specified in the website specifications. For example, if a user
  group is be allowed to edit files in "/about/company", make sure it
  cannot edit any other files. Check permissions for all the other website
  objects represented as files: menus, website templates etc.<br>
</li> 

<li>Check access permissions for all of the existing information blocks: "Content
  > Information blocks > Information block types > Information block name",
  click the "Access" tab. If a user group needs to view but not edit
  the information block contents, use the "Read" access permission and
  never - "Edit".<br>
</li>

<li>If the website specifications demand Control Panel access for certain user
  groups, authorize as a member of each of these user groups and check that only
  the allowed information is visible and only the allowed management functions
  are available. A common unpleasant surprise for a system administrator is
  seeing, for example, a web store customer able to log on to Control Panel and
  do whatever they like.<br>
</li> 

<li>Log on to the public section as a member of each of the existing user groups.
  Verify that the user group's permissions conform to the actions and
  operations a user is expected to be able to perform.<br>
</li>

<li>Check the user accounts added to the "Administrators" user group:
  open the latter for editing, click the "Parameters" tab and scroll to "Users
  in this group". Does all of the users you see here really need administrative
  access? It is infrequent to discover long forgotten remains of some test user
  accounts here.<br>
</li>
<li>When logged in as a user, search for any information a user should not be
  able to access. If you can, change the permissions accordingly.</li> 
 </ol>

<p>In the end, you will have the access levels of your user groups properly
properly configured for minimum required permissions.</p>
