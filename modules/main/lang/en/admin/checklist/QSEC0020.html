<p>Administrative accounts with maximum permissions are among the most common
victims of hacker attacks. To protect these accounts, set them to use the
highest security level and OTP authentication. This will make attacks almost
vain and useless.</p>

<ol>
<li>Open "Settings > Users > User Groups", select
  "Administrators" (the group ID is 1). Click the "Security" tab; the
  predefined security level should be set to "High" or better.<p>Click the "Parameters"
  tab and verify that all the user accounts in the "Administrators" user
  group use OTP authentication.</p></li>
<li>Open "Settings > Proactive Protection > One-Time Passwords". OTP must be
  enabled.</li> 
<li>Ensure that each of the administrative user accounts uses OTP ("Settings >
  Users > Users").</li> 
<li>If required, use high security level and/or OTP for other potentially
  vulnerable user groups (e-store administrators etc.).</li>
