<p>Information blocks store the web project data: news, catalogs and other
information. Proper configuration of information blocks and their underlying
types is of extreme importance for the usability of the web project, its
performance and maintenance cost because a streamlined and simple data scheme is
easier to maintain and extend. It is recommended to disable unused features.</p>

<p>Check the information block types: "Content &gt; Information blocks &gt; Information
block types". Open the existing information block types for editing, one by
one.</p>
<ol>
<li>An information block type must have a clear, comprehensive and distinctive
  name.
  "Type1" or "t1" is what you should not call your information
  block types. "Company news" is an example of a good name because it
  is self descriptive.</li>
<li>Click the "Main" tab. Check that an information block type has
  custom names for sections and elements appropriate for data the information
  blocks of this type will store.</li> 
<li>Click the "Additional" tab. The "Use RSS export" option
  should be enabled only if the information blocks of this type will ever need
  to be exported.</li> 
 </ol>

<p>Check the parameters of the information blocks: "Content &gt; Information blocks &gt;
Information block types", select the existing information blocks one by
one.</p>

<ol>
<li>The property storage (the "Property values are stored..." option)
  depends on the information block purpose and data size. If there will be a
  huge number of elements (hundreds of thousands or millions), use a separate
  table. To improve performance, assign individual field indexes to these tables.<p>However,
  if the property count may possibly exceed the maximum database column count,
  use "common table".</p>
</li>

<li>Ensure the information block is selected for use on the websites for which
  it is destined.</li> 

<li>If the information block contents needs to be searchable using the website
  search featuire, enable the "Index ... for the Search module"
  options. Otherwise, disable these options to improve performance.</li> 

<li>If none of the information block objects will ever be accessed by the
  Workflow or Business Process module, disable this feature.</li>

<li>Select view mode depending on the expected data size and ease of
  administration. For huge amount of data (hundreds of thousands of elements),
  use separate mode.
</li> 

<li>Click the "Fields" tab. Verify the default property values.
  Properly configured default values will improve usability.</li> 

<li>Click the "Properties" tab. Check that all properties have clear, comprehensive and distinctive
  names.
  "MyNiceProp" or "p1" is what you should not call your
  properties. It is important to select a correct property type. For example, if
  a property will store date, use the "Date/Time" type rather than a
  simple string.</li>

<li>If the information block elements need to be filtered by one or more
  properties, check the "Use property in a filter..." option in the
  property settings. This will improve usability and make the content editor's
  life easier.</li> 

<li>Check the section parameters in a similar way, on the "Section Fields"
  tab.</li> 

<li>The values on the "Commercial Catalog" tab should be set only if your web
  project will use this mode. Otherwise, disable these options for better
  performance.</li>

<li>Click the "Properties" tab. Verify that the access permissions are
  adequate. For example, an imaginary "Private data" information block
  must not be available to visitors and common users. Access permissions must be
  consistent with tasks a respective user group is set to perform. Never give
  redundant access permissions to any user group. If new data added to an
  information block needs to be moderated before it becomes available to public,
  use the "Workflow" permission or use business processes.</li> 

<li>Select the "Titles" tab. Ensure that the titles are logically
  consistent with the information block purpose and data. For example, if an
  information block contains water-pipes for sale, the elements title should not
  read "Oranges".</li> 

<li>Select the "Event Log" tab. The settings on this tab must match
  the project specifications on the event logging.</li>

<li>For large projects containing dozens of information block types and hundreds
  of information blocks, create a data model; use any diagramming approach you
  find most comprehensive. This will help developers and website editors see a
  larger picture, find data links and minimize development error risks.
  Furthermore, the model will come in handy when a developer needs to know if an
  information block elements can be deleted safely because there may be other
  elements referring to this one.</li> 
 </ol>
