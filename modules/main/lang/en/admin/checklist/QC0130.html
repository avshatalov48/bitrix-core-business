<p>If your project contains a considerable size of code devoted to a particular
task, it would be reasonable to shape it as a Bitrix Framework module. This will
impart good structure to the code, decrease its complexity and improve maintainability.
Another useful implication of this approach is the ability to distribute module
updates via Marketplace.</p>

<p>It is recommended to use OOP (encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance etc.)
and design templates (not to be confused with website templates here) if the
module code is massive and complicated.</p>

<p>Sometimes developers place all the code they create for a website in
initialization files like init.php. Over time, these files become rather large
which deteriorates web project manageability, increase development errors and brings down
performance. The latter will likely degrade even more if such ini-files
intensively call the Bitrix Framework API's database functions.</p>


<ul>
  <li>Ensure that the custom code is shaped as a Bitrix Framework module rather
    than scattered across the initialization files (init.php etc.).</li>
</ul>
