Have the auto backup feature create the most recent copy of your data for you for recovery in case of hardware or software failure. 

Bitrix Cloud Monitor will create backup copies by navigating to a special URL at your website at scheduled time. The URL includes a secret ID that allows a caller to create the backup copy but not access it. No access to your website's Conrol Panel is needed and may be blocked by IP.

By default, the backup copy is saved to Bitrix Cloud in encrypted form in multiple locations. This is the most secure way to preserve your data.
