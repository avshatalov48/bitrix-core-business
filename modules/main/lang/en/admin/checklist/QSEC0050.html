<p>Use only strong passwords for the database connection. A strong password
should include letters in varying case, digits and punctuation marks and contain
at least 8 characters. This will reduce the risk of successful password
bruteforce.</p>

<p>The database should be accessed using a dedicated account with minimum
sufficient access privileges (not "root").</p>


<ol>
<li>Verify that the password follows the security guidelines in "/bitrix/php_interface/dbconn.php"
  ("$DBPassword" variable).</li>
<li>Check the privileges of the database access account.</li>
