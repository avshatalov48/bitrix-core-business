<p>The caching subsystem is one of the key elements to guarantee maximum website
performance.</p>

<p>The website pages use special building blocks commonly known as components,
for example: "Sitemap", "News", "Catalog Page" etc. The components
interact with a website visitor (or perform other useful work) by drawing
information from the database. It is obvious that a highly popular website will
produce an enormous number of database queries.</p> 

<p>The simplest way to decrease database load is to use caching in all the
components of your website. </p>

<p>The standard Bitrix components makes extensive use of the caching technology
which makes them extremely efficient. This is one of the reasons that you have
to keep close watch on the custom components in your web project: make sure that
all of them use caching. </p>

<p>A special button exists in Control Panel to enable or disable caching in all
components at once. </p>

<p>How to perform the test?</p>

<p>Open "Settings > System Settings > Cache settings". Ensure that the component
cache is enabled. </p>

<p>Also verify that all the components in your web project are set to use "Auto+Managed"
or "Auto" cache mode. It is not infrequent for a developer to set the
cache mode to "Cache" èëè "Don't cache" for debugging purposes and then
forget to revert back to normal mode:</p>
