<p>For more efficient content and information management, it is worthwhile to
create and properly configure a content editors user group that will comprise
employees whose role is to:</p>

<ul>
<li>create and edit web pages, website sections and properties;</li>
<li>create and edit menu items;</li> 
<li>create and edit include areas;</li>
<li>create and edit elements and sections of designated information blocks;</li> 
<li>add components to the website pages and configure their parameters;</li> 
<li>fulfill other information management tasks.</li> 
 </ul>

<p>At the same time, it is essential to deny access of the content editors to critical
data and settings of the website in order to strengthen the web project security.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Verify that a content editors user group exists and is configured. Test
    all the actions a member of this user group may need to perform: no insufficient
    permission errors must occur when editing web pages or include areas etc.</li>
  <li>Verify that the members of the content editors user group don't have
    access to the system areas, such as Kernel settings, user group management,
    e-Store customer profiles etc.</li>
</ul>
