<p>The performance of a web system configuration is inversely proportional to
the average response time. In other words, the faster the web server software,
database and scripts, the higher the performance. </p>

<p>In general, the following sequence of actions is recommended.</p>

<ol>
<li>Configure and optimize the server software so as to achieve maximum performance
  score.</li>
<li>If despite all efforts an acceptable performance score cannot be reached,
  use more powerful hardware.</li> 
<li>For high load web projects, a performance score of 30 or better is strongly
  recommended. Perform measurements on a monthly basis and maintain the reached
  score by optimizing the scripts and database tables.</li> 
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Open "Settings > Performance > Performance Panel > Configuration". Click "Test
    configuration". Once completed, the test result (the performance score) will
    show up in the "Score" column.</li>
</ul>
<p>The performance is unacceptably low if the score of 15 or less; acceptable if
the score is 15 to 30 and high for the score values of 30 or more.</p>
