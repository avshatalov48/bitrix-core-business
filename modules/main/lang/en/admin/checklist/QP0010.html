<p>To achieve best performance of your Bitrix Framework powered web project, you have to configure the server software.
Unfortunately, the default settings of server software (web server, database
etc.) are not optimized for extreme working load or high concurrency.</p>

<p>For faster configuration of server software, use one of the following options:</p>

<ul>
<li>use Bitrix Environment (for Windows or Linux); the installation wizard will
  set the software parameters for best or optimum performance automatically; </li>
<li>use Bitrix Virtual Appliance which comes preconfigured for best performance. </li> 
 </ul>
 
<p>After a thorough examination of one of these products, a skilled system
administrator will be able to configure the server software manually. It is
essential to have a good understanding of the meaning and implications that a
particular parameter may have.</p>


<ol>
<li>Ensure the web server is configured for best performance.</li>
<li>Ensure the caching proxy server (nginx or similar) is configured for maximum
  performance for static content. A properly configured caching proxy server
  significantly improves response time and stability.</li> 
<li>Ensure that, at a peak load level, the web and proxy servers will be
  enqueuing requests properly rather than hanging other server software (for the
  Apache server, the maximum available connection slots must be set according to
  the average process and RAM size). It is recommended to use a two-tier
  configuration: front-end (nginx or similar) and back-end (apache, FastCGI etc.).</li> 
<li>Ensure the database is configured for optimum performance. For MySQL:
<ul>
<li>use InnoDB table format for high load websites;</li>
<li>ensure the innodb buffer pool is sufficient for the current size of the
  website content and the server RAM;</li> 
<li>ensure that other buffers and parameters follow the Bitrix Framework
  recommendations; the disk subsystem is configured for maximum performance or
  the value of "innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit" is biased towards higher speed;</li> 
<li>open "Desktop/Settings/Performance/Database server" and ensure that there is
  no red notifications;</li> 
<li>ensure the server still has enough free RAM (Global buffers + Connection
  buffers * Connections) even if all available database connections are in use.</li> 
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>These tests are optional if Bitrix Environment or Bitrix Virtual Appliance
was used for server setup.</p>
