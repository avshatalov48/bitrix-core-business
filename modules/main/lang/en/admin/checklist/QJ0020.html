<p>Web solutions designed using Bitrix Framework must not introduce any
modification to the system kernel because such changes will not allow the system
to update itself safely. If a system with modified kernel is updated forcedly,
the whole web project may (and most likely will) become inoperative. </p>

<p>It is not infrequent that a hasty developer attempts to modify the system
kernel to implement the desired functionality because he or she is unaware of
existing <a href="http://www.bitrixsoft.com/help/source/main/help/en/developer/general/technology/events.php.html" target="_blank">event
handler technology</a> allowing to achieve the same result in a safer way.</p>

<p>If you cannot add the required features using event handlers, you can create
a <a href="http://www.bitrixsoft.com/help/source/main/help/en/developer/general/modules/index.php.html" target="_blank">custom
module</a> which in the end will leave the system kernel untouched. </p>

<ol>
<li>Use a development tool (file version and database control system) or an
  automated test to ensure the Bitrix Framework kernel was never modified.</li>

<li>Once the project development stage has been completed, update the kernel
  using the SiteUpdate system and verify that the updated system functions
  correctly.</li> 
 </ol>
