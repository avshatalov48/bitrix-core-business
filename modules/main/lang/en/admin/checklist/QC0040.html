<p>Sometimes developers don't understand why they would need to use caching
in their custom components. Really, why? Wouldn't it be simpler to just call the
database API methods and format output?</p>

<p>Yes, it's just that neat and simple and will work if your website serves one
user. Well, perhaps not one, but it will work for up to 10 or 20 concurrent
users depending on the hardware. But as the number of concurrent users grow, the
website's life is getting insufferable. If a Component 2.0 working cycle
performing 100 uncached database transactions is 0.1 sec, a hundred of
concurrent users would require 10.000 transactions and the component working
cycle will reach unacceptable 5 to 10 sec.</p>

<p>Remember that the cache speed is dramatically higher than that of the
database. If a component generates output for 2 sec in uncached mode, the first
user will be served in 2 sec (to fetch the initial data from the database and
put in on cache), while all subsequent users will be served much faster, in 0.1
sec approximately.</p>

<p>Another matter that require good understanding is cache lifetime. In "Auto+Managed"
mode, the system tracks changes in database records and resets cache chunks
whenever a particular record changes. In "Auto" mode, the component is
responsible for setting the cache lifetime; it is recommended to set the maximum
possible time interval according to the underlying business logic.</p>

<p>To summarize:</p>
<ul>
<li>the use of cache gives your website a significant performance boost;</li>
<li>visitors enjoy high speed browsing.</li> 
 </ul>


<ul>
  <li>Check that all the custom components use caching, and the appropriate
    cache lifetime is set.</li>
  <li>The cache type should be set to "Auto+Managed" èëè "Auto". If you see
    the cache type is set to just "Cache", change it to "Auto"
    for easier website administration.</li>
  <li>The cache lifetime for "Auto+Managed" mode should be considerably long, 1
    year or so. For "Auto" mode, set the lifetime value according to assumed
    frequency of information update.</li>
  <li>Open Control Panel, "Settings &gt; System Settings &gt; Cache Settings". Click
    the "Components Cache" tab and ensure that the cache is enabled.
    Click the "Managed Cache" tab, ensure that the managed cache is
    enabled as well.</li>
</ul>
