<p>Bitrix Environment, and consequently a web project on which it is built,
stores information:</p>
<ul>
<li>in files;</li>
<li>in database.</li> 
 </ul>


<p>To create a copy of the web project, use the form "Settings &gt; Tools &gt; Backup".</p>

<p>However, it is strongly recommended that you set up your system to create
automated regular backups to protect your project against software or hardware
failure. Use <a href="http://www.bitrixsoft.com/products/cms/features/web_cluster.php">web
cluster</a> technology to reach even higher level of robustness and availability
of your data.</p>

<ol>
<li>Ensure that your system is configured to create regular backups. Or, at
  least, always remember to create manual backups.<p>For example, if you create
  backups manually, the page "Settings &gt; Tools &gt; Backup" must contain
  backup copies for a certain period of time (for example, a week), and the most
  recent backup copy must be created one day ago.</p>

  <p>If your system is configured for automated backups, using either the system
  tools or by hosting company, you must ensure that such backups really take
  place. Ask your hosting company to show you the backups. You should control
  the backup on a regular basis.</p></li>
<li>Ensure that the backup copy data:
	<ul>
		<li>is accessible;</li>
		<li>it can be used for recovery. </li> 
</ul>
  <p>The problem is that, while the backup copiess are really created, they do
  not contain all data required for successful recovery, or data may be damaged.
  To prevent such situations, attempt to recover the web project from the backup
  copy to a temporary location on a regular basis.</p></li> 
<li>Keep in mind that even if your system is backed up daily, an unexpected
  failure will bury all data that the system has collected after the most recent
  backup. If your project deals with sensitive information like financial
  transactions or orders, use database replication.<p>If
  your project is sensitive to loss of files, configure the system for more
  frequent backups or, if the total file size is too large, use the file system
  snapshot technology (LVM, special storages, cloud storages etc.)</p>

</li> 
 </ol>
