<p>The website's information blocks store information intended to be updated by
the content editors, e-store administrators or other users with respective
permissions. The "News", "Jobs", "Dictionary",
product catalog are among the most common examples of such information blocks.</p>

<p>Because information blocks can keep absolutely different sorts of
information, it is essential to provide users with multiple different edit forms
each of which is customized to the type of data an information block contains.</p>

<ol>
<li>Inspect every information block element edit form which will be used by the
  users to update information. The edit forms should not include redundant or
  unnecessary controls. For example, if an element is to store the color value
  only, the edit form should not show confusing properties like «Short
  Description», «Detailed Description», «Tags».</li>
<li>Check the information block element tables (summary forms). The element
  tables should show only the columns that are directly related to information
  the elements store.</li> </ol>
