<p>To provide best information security, perform auditing of events and
incidents recorded by the event log.</p>

<p>Depending on current settings, the event log may keep track of virus activity
events, attacks (registered by the proactive filter), changes in sections and
elements of information blocks, forum moderator activity, authorization and
registration events, user profile changes, file and module access permission
changes and other events.</p>

<p>First of all, set the required storage time for the events in the log. Open "Settings
> System Settings > Module Settings", select "Kernel" in the
drop-down list. Click the "Event Log" tab and set the "Keep events
(days)" value. The right storage time depends on how often the security
auditing will be performed. For example, you may opt for weekly review of all
events and daily review of virus and attack related events. In that case, a 2 or
4 week time period is a good choice.</p>
  
<p>Next, configure the types of events to register.</p>

<p>Open "Settings &gt; System Settings &gt; Module Settings", select
"Kernel" in the drop-down list. Click the "Event Log" tab.
Under the "Log events" section, select the required events. It is
recommended to log all events.</p>

<p>If required, enable the web antivirus and select a required virus logging
mode. Open "Settings &gt; Proactive Protection &gt; Web Antivirus" and
click the "Activate web antivirus" button. Select the
"Parameters" tab and choose one of the actions.</p>

<p>Now enable the proactive filter here: "Settings &gt; Proactive
Protection &gt; Proactive Filter" by clicking the "Enable Proactive
Protection" button. Select the "Active Reaction" tab and check
the "Add Intrusion Attempt to Log" box. Optionally, you may disable
the website for the attacker's IP address.</p>

<p>If the website specifications specify to log the information block
modification events, select such events for each of the information blocks
individually: "Content > Information Blocks > Information Block Types", the "Event
Log" tab. It is wise to keep track of events of the information blocks
containing crucial information like price or SKU catalog.</p>

<p>Now, to perform the auditing, open the "Event Log" form: "Settings &gt;
Tools &gt; Event Log".</p>


<ol>
<li>Make sure all the events mentioned in the website specifications are set to
  be logged:
<ul>
<li>"Settings &gt; System Settings &gt; Module Settings", Kernel (main) module, "Event
  Log" tab;</li>
<li>"Settings &gt; Proactive Protection &gt; Web Antivirus", "Parameters"
  tab;</li> 
<li>"Settings &gt; Proactive Protection &gt; Proactive Filter", "Active
  Reaction" tab,</li> 
<li>"Content &gt; Information Blocks &gt; Information Block Types", select
  each of the required information blocks one by one, use the "Event Log"
  tab.</li>
 </ul>
</li>
<li>Make sure a formal procedure exists (best if defined in the website
  specifications) to perform the security auditing and countermeasures.
<p>Example: if an attack occurs, then a system administrator blocks the
attacker's IP address; if a virus activity is detected, then a machine is
quarantined from which a virus originated and so on.</p>
</li>
