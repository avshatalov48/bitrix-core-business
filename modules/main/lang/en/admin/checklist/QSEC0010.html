<p>All the new releases and updates of Bitrix Framework are thoroughly tested by
the IT security department. Nevertheless, the following threats may still
persist.</p>

<ul>
<li>Coding errors committed when developing a Bitrix Framework powered solution.</li>

<li>Registered users confide in easy to remember but weak passwords like <i>qwerty
  </i>or <i>123456</i>.</li> 

<li>The website administrators may also tend to use weak passwords which is
  significantly more dangerous.</li>

<li>Attackers can be very resourceful to intercept passwords transmitted over
  insecure connections like wi-fi.</li>

<li>Inappropriately authored system errors may reveal the web solution intrinsics.</li>

<li>Server and database software may have unknown errors which attackers may
  exploit.</li> 

 </ul>

<p>Therefore, it is obvious that a web project requires an integrated,
multilevel approach to defending its security. Relying on only one tool or
software is unwise and ultimately dangerous.</p>

<p>To provide a web project with an adequate level of security, select the
"Standard" security option (proactive protection and activity control
are enabled, administrator security level is set to "High",
CAPTCHA-protected registration; no system information is included in error
messages).  </p>

<p>To protect session data and passwords, prevent phishing and viruses,
give extra protection to Control Panel – set the security level to
"High" or "Highest".  </p>

<ol>
<li>Open "Settings > Proactive Protection > Protection Panel". Ensure the
  security level is not lower than
"Standard". Otherwise, follow the Control Panel recommendations to
  reach this level.</li>
<li>If required, follow the Control Panel recommendations to reach the
  "High" or "Highest" level.</li> 
 </ol>
